Enhancing Hardware Security: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning and  Deep Learning Approaches for Detecting Hardware Trojans:

In the current landscape, the security of IoT devices garners significant attention from both researchers and malicious actors due to their vulnerabilities. Hence, prioritizing hardware security is imperative, particularly in countering hardware trojans, which pose substantial threats to device integrity. This project underscores the critical importance of secure integrated circuits (ICs) in ensuring the safety of IoT devices globally. The rapid pace of technological advancement compels modern businesses to outsource circuit design, inadvertently creating opportunities for hardware trojans to infiltrate. These insidious trojans clandestinely compromise ICs, leading to data breaches and performance degradation, with potentially devastating consequences. Mitigating these risks necessitates a multifaceted approach, incorporating traditional and machine learning-based methodologies. Through meticulous experimentation, various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were assessed for their efficacy in detecting trojan-infected ICs. Notably, the Gradient Boosting algorithm emerged as the most accurate for hardware trojan detection and accuracy is 99.56% . Additionally, the model's performance was benchmarked against existing projects, confirming its superior accuracy. This study underscores the critical need for vigilance in addressing evolving cybersecurity threats and offers actionable insights for bolstering digital infrastructure security.
